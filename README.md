A basic social media app with a RESTful backend to perform CRUD operations.

The application allows for users to:
- create, edit, delete posts & comments
- edit a public profile to interact with others
- follow other users
- upload images

A demo version of the frontend can be visited here: https://mario-florio.github.io/social-media-app/

## DISCLAIMER
The demo version does not consist of any features linked to a database (e.g. saving user data, uploading images, etc.) and is simply for viewing the contents of the frontend. Users will be able to post, view other (mock) users profile, comment on others posts, and edit a profile. On the demo version, you can log into any of the pre-created users (see below for credentials) or make your own account. Any changes made to the data during the demo run will be reset upon refreshing the page (including any accounts made).
