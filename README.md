# Social Media App
A basic social media app using a RESTful backend to perform CRUD operations.

The application allows for users to:
- create, edit and delete posts & comments
- edit a public profile to interact with others
- follow other users
- upload images

Access to a demo version can be visited [here](https://mario-florio.github.io/social-media-app/).

##### Disclaimer: The demo version does not consist of any features linked to a database (e.g. saving user data, uploading images, etc.) and is simply for testing the frontend. Users of demo version will still be able to post, view other (mock) user profiles, comment on others posts, and edit a profile. However, any changes made to the data during the demo run will be reset upon refreshing the page (including any accounts made). For access to the full featured version, see the [setup guide](#setup) to get the application running on your local machine.
